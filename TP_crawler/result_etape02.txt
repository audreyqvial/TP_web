            <?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="lead"?><?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?><?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?><h1>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</h1><p>The present invention relates to a method for and use of digital holographic microscopy and imaging for detecting molecules or structures stained or labelled to at least one cell or conjugated to antibodies which are bound either directly to said at least one cell or indirectly via another or several anti-bodies in a chain bound to said at least one cell.</p><h1>BACKGROUND ART</h1><p>There exists a never ending demand for additional and more accurate information about biological objects, such as cells, in humans, animals, plants and other organisms. Cells are very thin and contain only very few structures that are easily identifiable using a light microscope. Several different methods have been developed to make cells and cell structures more visible. Many of the methods include stains that colour the entire cell or stains that colour only certain cell structures. These stains can be fluorescent or non-fluorescent. An example is trypan blue which is a widely used non-fluorescent stain that colours the entire cell blue. Trypan blue is only used for dead cells. The exact methods used to stain the cells vary as different stains have different properties. A rather recent labelling method is to induce the cell itself to produce a fluorescent substance such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). This labelling can be either very selective, showing a specific cell structure, or non-selective, showing the entire cell. Another widely used method called immuno-labelling is to label the cells using antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that are found in the body fluids of vertebrates. Antibodies bind to substances and particles, e.g. bacteria or viruses, which are thus recognized as foreign objects, and they target very specific structures. This is useful for biological and medical research as antibodies can be used to identify very specific small structures in a cell or parts of a cell. Antibodies are very difficult to detect, but they can be conjugated to a wide array of different molecules or structures that make them clearly visible. Different antibody conjugates are suited for different detection methods such as light microscopy, electron microscopy, spectrometry or radioactivity measurements. Conjugated antibodies can be used to bind directly to a target. If a stronger signal is needed, the signal can be amplified by first allowing unlabelled antibodies to bind to the target, and then allow a second set of conjugated antibodies to bind to the first set of non-conjugated antibodies. The first set of antibodies is called primary anti-bodies and the second set is called secondary antibodies. Further layers of antibodies can be used if the signal needs more amplification.</p><p>Different types of stains, labels and antibody conjugates have different light-related characteristics such as the ability to absorb light at several or a few wavelengths, to emit light at certain wavelengths, to disperse light or to polarize light. These different characteristics allow the stains to show as colouring or fluorescence when using a light microscope, a phase contrast microscope, a fluorescence microscope or a flow cytometer. The stains, labels or conjugates can also be measured using e.g. a spectrophotometer or a fluorescence plate reader.</p><p>Examples of antibody conjugates which render absorption differences are quantum dots, plastic balls, glass beads and semiconductors. Examples of antibody conjugates which scatter light or polarize it are dynabeads, gold particles, nano crystals or magnetic beads.</p><p>Digital holographic microscopy enables the study of living cells without the need for markers. In WO2009/154558, which describes an observation vessel for digital holographic microscopy and a method for digital holographic microscopy by use of said vessel, there is disclosed that digital holographic microscopy enables studies of living cells without the need for markers or stains. Fact is that digital holographic microscopy and imaging renders monochromatic images, which up til now have implied that such technology has not been interesting for analysing labelled or stained cell samples. The use of markers is increasing, so also the interest in such markers and the possible applications in relation thereto for different sample analysis.</p><p>One way to study cells by means of digital holographic microscopy is disclosed in WO 2007/073345, where a method for analyzing a stage of development of cells and a device for enablement of the analysis is disclosed.</p><p>As mentioned above, another method for studying cells by means of digital holographic microscopy is disclosed in WO2009/154558.</p><p>As said above, the technology of digital holographic microscopy and imaging renders monochromatic images. This implies that this technology, e.g. defined in the inventions disclosed in WO 2007/073345 and WO2009/154558, has not been of interest in relation to use of labelling and staining of cell samples.</p><h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1><p>The present invention is directed to use of a digital holographic microscopy and imaging setup for detecting molecules or structures stained or labelled to at least one cell or conjugated to antibodies which are bound either directly to said at least one cell or indirectly via another or several antibodies in a chain bound to said at least one cell.</p><p>Moreover, the present invention also refers to a method for detecting such molecules or structures, said method comprising the steps of performing digital holographic microscopy and imaging on a cell sample by</p><p>a) creating at least one object beam and at least one reference beam of light, where said at least one object beam and said at least one reference beam are mutually coherent;</p><p>b) exposing said cell sample to said at least one object beam;</p><p>c) superimposing said at least one object beam that has passed through said cell sample with said at least one reference beam and thereby creating an interference pattern;</p><p>d) detecting said interference pattern, called hologram;</p><p>e) reconstructing phase and/or amplitude information of object wavefront from said interference pattern; and</p><p>f) constructing at least one cell analysis image for detection of molecules or structures stained or labelled to at least one cell or conjugated to antibodies which are bound either directly to said at least one cell or indirectly via another or several antibodies in a chain bound to said at least one cell.</p><?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?><?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</h1><p>In digital holography microscopy, several focal planes may be studied without having to mechanically set the microscope in relation to the different focal planes. Instead the different focal planes may be studied by processing the achieved data. Thereby, 3-dimensional images may be obtained. In particular, this method achieves a low rate of undesired interference, low levels of noise, accurate phase and amplitude information about a cell sample as well as high-resolution holographic images of the cell sample.</p><p>In one embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the mutually coherent at least one object beam and at least one reference beam of light are created by dividing a light beam originating from a coherent light source into two beams e.g. by means of a beam splitter. The light beam originating from a coherent light source may be a laser beam. The laser beam may originate from any kind of laser source, such as a He—Ne or a diode laser. Preferably a diode laser is used. The laser source may be linearly polarized.</p><p>The object beam and the reference beam are mutually coherent, which implies that they have the same wavelength and exhibit a constant phase relationship during the course of time.</p><p>The object beam is passed through the cell sample. The reference beam is left unaffected by the cell sample, since the reference beam is guided another path than the object beam, e.g. by means of beam splitters, mirrors and/or fibre optics.</p><p>The object beam has a known wavefront before passing through the cell sample. When the object beam passes through the at least one cell sample, the cell sample substantially does not absorb any light, but the light that travels through the cell sample will experience a difference in the optical path length compared to the surrounding medium. The wavefront that emerges from the cell sample, the object wavefront, will thus be phase shifted. Naturally, also the reference beam has a known wavefront. The optical path length is defined as the physical/geometrical thickness multiplied with the refractive index.</p><p>In one embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the superimposing of the at least one object beam that has passed through the cell sample and the at least one reference beam is achieved by bringing the two beams together e.g. by means of another beam splitter. This superimposition gives rise to an interference pattern, which for example includes information about the object wavefront that is affected by the at least one cell sample.</p><p>In one embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the interference pattern is detected by means of a digital sensor, such as a CCD or a CMOS. The detected interference pattern is called a hologram.</p><p>In order to superimpose the at least one object beam that has passed through the cell sample and the at least one reference beam and thereby creating an interference pattern and to detect the interference pattern for example a Fourier setup or a Fresnel setup may be used. Preferably a Fresnel setup is used. The difference between a Fourier setup and a Fresnel setup may be described as a difference in the optical configuration implying that a certain condition is fulfilled which makes an approximation, e.g. a Fresnel approximation, applicable in the reconstruction algorithm. This approximation simplifies the process of image reconstruction. In case of a Fresnel setup, the condition is that the distance between the object and the sensor is large compared to the size of the object and the size of the sensor. This is achieved by use of a microscope objective that collects the scattered light from the object and directs it to the sensor in an almost parallel light beam. This creates a virtual object that is positioned far away from the sensor.</p><p>From the detected interference pattern phase and/or amplitude information of the object wavefront is reconstructed. The reconstruction is carried out by means of any common numerical reconstruction process such as Fourier transform reconstruction or convolution reconstruction. The amplitude information may be used to set the focal plane of interest. The reconstructed information may for example be used to obtain an image in two dimensions or a 3D representation of the studied cell sample.</p><p>As an alternative for creating one object beam and one reference beam, in-line digital holography may be used. It is obvious for a person skilled in the art how to modify the method of the present invention in order to use inline digital holography, when studying this specification.</p><p>The obtained image is further used in image processing conducted by a computer in order to determine useful information about the studied object, such as shape, volume and optical density.</p><p>Several obtained images may also be further used in image processing in order to determine additional useful information about the studied object, such as changes in shape, volume and optical density.</p><h1>SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</h1><p>In some embodiments, the molecules or structures or the antibodies are bound to the cell surface of said at least one cell. This further improves the lenience of the present invention, since the risk of harming the cell is decreased.</p><p>In some embodiments of the use of a digital holographic microscopy and imaging setup according to the present invention, the molecules or structures have a light absorption peak within a specific wavelength range and/or shift the polarization direction of a beam of light used in the digital holographic microscopy and imaging setup. By using molecules or structures that have a light absorption peak within a specific wavelength range the molecules or structures may be detected. By using molecules or structures that shift the polarization direction of a beam of light the molecules or structures may be detected.</p><p>According to one specific embodiment of the use of a digital holographic microscopy and imaging setup according to the present invention, more than one type of molecules or structures are stained or labelled to at least one cell at the same place or places of said cell or conjugated to the same type of antibodies which are bound either directly to said at least one cell or indirectly via another or several antibodies in a chain bound to said at least one cell, and wherein at least one of the molecules or structures have a light absorption peak within a specific wavelength range and at least one of the molecules or structures shift the polarization direction of a beam of light used in the digital holographic microscopy and imaging setup. According to this embodiment, molecules or structures having the ability to absorb light with a peak within a specific wavelength range are used together with molecules or structures having the ability to shift the polarization direction, i.e. two different types of molecules or structures are used. By combining these characteristics, it is possible to obtain both images created from light with different wavelengths and images created by different polarization directions. When having both these kinds of images, the certainty of the detection of the cell the molecules or structures are bound to is increased.</p><p>In some embodiments of the use of a digital holographic microscopy and imaging setup according to the present invention, the specific molecules or structures used have a light absorption peak within a specific wavelength range and shift the polarization direction of a beam of light used in the digital holographic microscopy and imaging setup. In these embodiments molecules or structures having both the ability to absorb light with a peak within a specific wavelength range and to shift the polarization direction are used, i.e. one type of molecules or structures are used. As said above, by combining these characteristics, it is possible to obtain both images created from light with different wavelengths and images created by different polarization directions. When having both these kinds of images, the certainty of the detection of the molecules or structures is increased and thus certainty of the detection of the cell the molecules or structures are bound to is increased.</p><p>In some embodiments of the use of a digital holographic microscopy and imaging setup according to the present invention, the digital holographic microscopy and imaging setup is arranged to expose said molecules or structures with light having at least two different wavelengths in comparison to one another. By exposing the molecules or structures with light having at least two different wavelengths the reliability of the detection of the molecules or structures is increased.</p><p>In some embodiments of the use of a digital holographic microscopy and imaging setup according to the present invention, the digital holographic microscopy and imaging setup is arranged to shift the polarization direction of at least one object beam of light and/or of at least one reference beam of light used in the digital holographic microscopy and imaging setup. By shifting the polarization direction of an object beam and/or a reference beam of light the reliability of the detection of the molecules or structures is increased.</p><p>Preferably, the polarization directions of the at least one object beam and the at least one reference beam are shifted so that the polarization directions obtained are perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to each other. From the beginning, the polarization directions of the at least one reference beam and of the at least one object beam are normally the same. However, for the detection of molecules or structure which have the ability to change the polarization directions of light in a randomised way, the polarization directions of the at least one object beam in relation to the at least one reference beam should be shifted towards being perpendicular to each other. According to this embodiment of the present invention, the angle of the polarization direction of the at least one object beam in relation to the at least one reference beam does not have to be exactly 90 or 270 degrees to be able to detect molecules or structures that shift the polarization direction of light or change the polarization direction in a randomized way. However, as the angle is shifted towards having a perpendicular polarization direction of the at least one object beam in relation to the polarization direction of the at least one reference beam, it will be easier to detect the molecules and structures. An angle of less than 90 degrees or more than 90 degrees will also work according to the present invention, such as an angle of e.g. between 75-89 degrees or e.g. 91-105 degrees, i.e. or 255-269 degrees or 271-285 degrees. However, at an angle of 90 or 270 degrees the only interference pattern detectable is from the molecules or structures which themselves change the polarization direction in a randomized way.</p><p>In relation to the method according to the present invention, according to one specific embodiment, two or more wavelengths are used, wherein the specific molecules or structures used have a light absorption peak in a wavelength range covering at least one, but not all of the two or more wavelengths, and wherein the steps a) to f) are performed for each of the used wavelengths, thereby enabling comparison of said one and same at least one cell in images obtained in step f) and created from light with different wavelengths.</p><p>By using two or more wavelengths it is possible to increase the reliability of the method according to the present invention. If molecules or structures are used which have a light absorption peak in a specific wavelength range, it is possible to use at least one wavelength within that range and one outside that range. As such, the actual detection of the molecules or structures may be determined.</p><p>Moreover, by using at least two wavelengths and produce an image for each of the used wavelengths it is possible to compare the obtained images. Since the molecules or structures used have a light absorption peak within a wavelength range covering at least one of the used wavelengths and not one other used wavelength, the molecules or structures will affect at least one of the images and not affect at least one other image. By comparing an affected and an unaffected image, the molecules or structures are detected.</p><p>One way to carry out the method involving two or more wavelengths is to first perform steps a) to f) for one of the used wavelengths and then perform steps a) to f) for one other of the used wavelengths and if more than two wavelengths are used perform steps a) to f) for the remaining wavelengths one at a time.</p><p>One alternative way is to first perform steps a) to d) for one of the used wavelengths and then perform steps a) to d) for one other of the used wavelengths and if more than two wavelengths are used perform steps a) to d) for the remaining wavelengths one at a time. Thereafter, steps e) and f) may be performed in parallel for all of the used wavelengths. This alternative way increases the speed with which the method is carried out, i.e. decreases the time for carrying out the method.</p><p>In some embodiments of the method according to the present invention, two wavelengths are used, one covered by the wavelength range in which the specific molecules or structures used have a light absorption peak, and one wavelength outside said wavelength range, and wherein two cell analysis images are constructed for comparison.</p><p>In general it is sufficient to carry out the method using two different wavelengths, since then one image affected by the molecules or structures is obtained and one image unaffected by the molecules or structures is obtained. Thus, it is possible to compare the two images and detect the molecules or structures. By only using two wavelengths, the efficiency of the method is increased compared with using more than two wavelengths. However, by using more than two wavelengths the accuracy increases.</p><p>According to another specific embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the specific molecules or structures used shift the polarization direction of light, and wherein steps a) to f) are performed at least once without and at least once with the addition to step a) of shifting the polarization direction of the object beam and/or reference beam, thereby enabling comparison of said one and same at least one cell in images obtained in step f) and created by different polarization directions.</p><p>In this embodiment, at least one image where the polarization direction is shifted by the molecules or structures used is produced. When the polarization direction of the object beam or the reference beam is shifted, molecules or structures which in themselves shift the polarization direction randomized are visualized. By only shifting the polarization directions of the at least one object beam and/or the at least one reference beam so that they are perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to each other, and not having any molecules or structures which shift the polarization direction in themselves, a “zero image” not showing anything would be obtained. However, if molecules or structures are used which shift the polarization direction these will be shown in an image according to this specific embodiment of the present invention. As such, this is also a way of removing risk of uncertainties in relation to if you in fact are seeing molecules or structures stained or labelled to at least one cell or conjugated to antibodies which are bound either directly to said at least one cell or indirectly via another or several antibodies in a chain bound to said at least one cell.</p><p>It is important to realize that the expression “shifting the polarization direction of the at least one object beam and/or the at least one reference beam” does not include shifting both the at least one object beam and the at least one reference beam at the same time in a way which corresponds to creating an image without shifting the polarization directions of the at least one object beam and/or the at least one reference beam in relation to one another, i.e. going back to the initial position or a corresponding position before shifting the polarization directions.</p><p>According to one specific embodiment of the method according to the present invention, the specific molecules or structures used shift the polarization direction of light, and wherein steps a) to f) are performed at least once without and at least once with the addition to step a) of shifting the polarization direction of the at least one object beam and/or at least one reference beam so that the polarization directions of the at least one object beam and the at least one reference beam are perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to each other, thereby enabling comparison of said one and same at least one cell in images obtained in step f) and created by different polarization directions. The interest in having perpendicular polarization directions of the at least one object beam in relation to the at least one reference beam is further explained above.</p><p>One way to carry out the method involving performing steps a) to f) without and with the addition to step a) of shifting the polarization direction of the object beam and/or reference beam is to first perform steps a) to f) without the addition to step a) and then perform steps a) to f) including shifting the polarization direction of the at least one object beam and/or the at least one reference beam.</p><p>One alternative way is to first perform steps a) to d) without the addition to step a) and then perform steps a) to d) including shifting the polarization direction of the object beam and/or reference. Thereafter, steps e) and f) may be performed in parallel for the sequences of steps a) to d) performed without and with the addition to step a). This alternative way increases the speed with which the method is carried out, i.e. decreases the time for carrying out the method.</p><p>In some embodiments of the method according to the present invention, more than one type of molecules or structures are used and wherein at least one of the molecules or structures have a light absorption peak within a specific wavelength range and at least one of the molecules or structures shift the polarization direction of the at least one object beam of light and/or the at least one reference beam of light. In these embodiments molecules or structures having the ability to absorb light with a peak within a specific wavelength range are used together with molecules or structures having the ability to shift the polarization direction, i.e. two different types of molecules or structures are used. By combining these characteristics, it is possible to obtain both images created from light with different wavelengths and images created by different polarization directions. When having both these kinds of images, the certainty of the detection of the cell the molecules or structures are bound to is increased.</p><p>In some embodiments of the method according to the present invention, the specific molecules or structures used have a light absorption peak within a specific wavelength range and shift the polarization direction of the at least one object beam of light and/or the at least one reference beam of light. In these embodiments molecules or structures having both the ability to absorb light with a peak within a specific wavelength range and to shift the polarization direction are used, i.e. one type of molecules or structures are used. As said above, by combining these characteristics, it is possible to obtain both images created from light with different wavelengths and images created by different polarization directions. When having both these kinds of images, the certainty of the detection of the molecules or structures is increased and thus certainty of the detection of the cell the molecules or structures are bound to is increased.</p><p>In some embodiments of the method according to the present invention, two or more wavelengths are used, wherein at least one type of the specific molecules or structures used have a light absorption peak in a wavelength range covering at least one, but not all of the two or more wavelengths used, wherein the steps a) to f) are performed for each of the used wavelengths, and wherein at least one type of the specific molecules or structures used shift the polarization direction of light, wherein the steps a) to f) are performed at least once without and at least once with the addition to step a) of shifting the polarization direction of the at least one object beam and/or the at least one reference beam, thereby enabling comparison of said one and same at least one cell in images created from light with different wavelengths and by different polarization directions. In these embodiments, images created from light with different wavelengths and images created by different polarization directions are obtained. Thereby it is possible to analyze both these factors and thereby the certainty of the detection of the molecules or structures may be increased and the certainty of the detection of the cell the molecules or structures are bound to is increased. The minimum number of images produced in these embodiments of the method is three. One of these images may be a reference image obtained with a first wavelength and without the addition to step a). One of these images may be an image obtained using a second wavelength and without the addition to step a). One of these images may be an image obtained with the first wavelength, but with the addition to step a). However, in order to increase the accuracy of the method, both the number of images created from light with different wavelengths and images created by different polarization directions may be increased. Moreover, also in this case the shifting of the polarization direction of the at least one object beam and/or the at least one reference beam may be performed so that the polarization directions of the at least one object beam and the at least one reference beam are perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to each other.</p><?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?>        </div>

            Optical solenoid beams, diffractionless solutions of the Helmholtz equation whose diffraction -limited in-plane intensity peak spirals around the optical axis, and whose wavefronts carry an independent helical pitch. The solenoid beams have the noteworthy property of being able to exert forces on illuminated objects that are directed opposite to the direction of the light's propagation. Optical solenoid beams therefore act as true tractor beams that are capable of transporting material back toward their source.         </div>

Additional forces arising from intensity gradients tend to draw small objects toward extrema of the intensity. These forces are exploited in single-beam optical traps known as optical tweezers, which capture microscopic objects at the focus of a strongly converging beam of light. Stable three-dimensional trapping results when axial intensity gradients are steep enough that the intensity-gradient force overcomes radiation pressure downstream of the focus. The beam of light in a tightly focused optical tweezer therefore has the remarkable property of drawing particles upstream against radiation pressure, at least near its focal point. Collimated beams of light generally have no axial intensity gradients, and therefore are not considered able to exert such retrograde forces.</p><h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1><p>One embodiment of the invention relates to a method for manipulating an object comprising generating a collimated beam of light, the beam of light having a frequency ω propagating along the {circumflex over (z)} direction. Then an optical force is exerted comprising intensity-gradient localization and phase-gradient driving on an object. In one embodiment, the optical force has a vector substantially opposite the direction of the light beam's propagation causing the object to be moved upstream relative to the light beam.</p><p>In one embodiment the invention relates to a system for exerting retrograde forces comprising a light source configured to provide a linearly polarized beam of light. A spatial light modulator is provided in communication with the light source and configured to imprint a hologram associated with a selected wavefront profile, u<sub>γ,l</sub>(r) onto the wavefronts of the linearly polarized beam of light. An optical component is configured to project the hologram into the far field. The linearly polarized beam of light has a principal intensity maximum which spirals around an optical axis and further having wavefronts characterized by an independent helical pitch.</p><p>In one embodiment the invention relates to a computer-implemented machine for manipulating an object. The computer implemented machine includes a processor and a tangible computer-readable medium operatively connected to the processor and including computer code configured to provide instructions to the machine. The computer code provides instructions to modify the wavefronts of a separately provided collimated beam of light, the beam of light having a frequency ω propagating along the {circumflex over (z)} direction; the modified beam exerts optical forces comprising intensity-gradient localization and phase-gradient driving on an object. The optical force includes a vector component substantially opposite the direction of the light beam's propagation causing the object to be moved upstream relative to the direction of propagation of the light beam. Such an optical solenoid beam therefore acts as a tractor beam, a traveling wave that can transport material back to its source without requiring additional actions to be taken beyond projecting the beam.</p><p>The foregoing summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting.

In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and made part of this disclosure.</p><p>The present invention provides a system and methods for producing and utilizing optical solenoid beams capable of exerting retrograde forces. In one embodiment, optical solenoid beams are provided whose principal intensity maximum spirals around the optical axis and whose wavefronts are characterized by an independent helical pitch. FIG. 1 shows theoretical and experimentally realized examples. These beams are solutions of the Helmholtz equation (∇<sup>2</sup>A+k<sup>2</sup>A=0), and thus propagate without diffraction, their radial intensity profiles remaining invariant in the spiraling frame of reference. Intensity gradients in a solenoid beam tend to draw small objects such as colloidal particles toward the one-dimensional spiral of maximum intensity. Radiation pressure directed by the beam's phase gradients then can drive the particle around the spiral. The combination of intensity-gradient localization and phase-gradient driving can create a component of the total optical force directed opposite to the light's direction of propagation, which can pull matter upstream along the beam's entire length. The vector potential for a beam of light at frequency ω propagating along the {circumflex over (z)} direction may be written as <br/> <?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>A</i>(<i>r,z,t</i>)=<i>u</i>(<i>r,z</i>)<i>e</i><sup>−iwt</sup>{circumflex over (ε)} (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?> <br/> where k=ω/c is the wave number of the light, {circumflex over (ε)} is its polarization vector and r measures the two-dimensional displacement from the beam's axis. The three-dimensional optical solenoid field u(r,z) is derived by considering the two-dimensional field u<sub>0</sub>(r) in the plane, z=0. Because the light propagating to z&gt;0 must first pass through the plane z=0, the field in this plane completely specifies the beam. Moreover, a featureless beam imprinted with the complex field u<sub>0</sub>(r) in the plane z=0 will propagate into the far field as u(r,z). In this sense, u<sub>0</sub>(r) may be considered the hologram encoding the desired beam. </p><p>Quite generally, u<sub>0</sub>(r) may be obtained from u(r, z) by formally back-propagating the three-dimensional field to z=0. This can be accomplished in scalar diffraction theory with the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld formula,</p><p><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>u</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>∫</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>u</mi><mo>⊗</mo><msub><mi>h</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo>ⅆ</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow><mo>⁢</mo><mstyle><mspace width="0.8em" height="0.8ex"/></mstyle><mo>⁢</mo><mi>where</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>h</mi><mi>z</mi></msub><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⁢</mo><mi>π</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>⁢</mo><mfrac><mo>∂</mo><mrow><mo>∂</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mi>ⅇ</mi><mrow><mi>ⅈ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mstyle><mspace width="0.3em" height="0.3ex"/></mstyle><mo>⁢</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow></msup><mo>⁢</mo><msqrt><mrow><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></mrow><msqrt><mrow><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>z</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></maths> <br/> is the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld propagator, and where the convolution is given by <br/> <?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(<i>u</i><img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="3.13mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US08922857-20141230-P00001.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif" orientation="portrait" inline="no"/><i>h</i><sub>—</sub><i>z</i>)(<i>r</i>)=∫<i>u</i>(<i>r</i><sup>1</sup><i>,z</i>)<i>h</i><sub>−z</sub>(<i>r−r</i><sup>1</sup>)<i>d</i><sup>2</sup><i>r</i><sup>1</sup> (4)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?> </p><p>It should be appreciated that, in one embodiment, this formalism can be useful even if the desired field, u(r, z), is not a solution of the Helmholtz equation, and so does not describe a physically realizable beam of light.

This representation does not describe a physically realizable beam of light because it neither incorporates self-diffraction nor locally conserves energy or momentum. Equations (2) through (5) nevertheless yield a physically realizable beam that has the desired properties along r<sub>0</sub>(z), provided that self-diffraction may be neglected. </p><p>Equation (4) is most easily computed with the Fourier convolution theorem. In that case, the two-dimensional Fourier transform of u<sub>0</sub>(r) is <br/> <?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>ũ<sub>0</sub>(q)=∫<sub>A</sub><sub><sub2>z</sub2></sub><sup>Z</sup><sup><sub2>z</sub2></sup>a(z)<sup>iφ(z)</sup><sup><sub2>a</sub2></sup><sup>−iqy0(z)e−iz(k2−Q2)1/2</sup>dz (7)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?> </p><p>An inverse Fourier transform then provides u<sub>0</sub>(r), and Eq. (5) yields the associated beam of light. This result extends to three dimensions the previously described two-dimensional holographic line traps and holographic ring traps in the plane.</p><p>In one embodiment, a first step toward deriving the solenoid beam is consideration of the case of an infinite line of light propagating along the optical axis, r<sub>0</sub>(z)=0, with uniform amplitude, a(z)=1, but with a specified axial phase gradient, φ(z)=βz. For 0≦β≦k, Eq. (7) has solutions: <br/> <?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>u</i><sub>0</sub>(<i>r</i>)=β<i>J</i><sub>0</sub>((<i>k</i><sup>2</sup>−β<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup><i>r</i>) (8)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?> <br/> and u<sub>p</sub>(r,z)=u<sub>0</sub>(r) exp(iβz) which is the zeroth-order Bessel beam. Although this defines an effectively infinitesimally finely resolved thread of light, formal back-propagation with Eq. (7) implicitly accounts for the beam's self-diffraction. The limit β=k corresponds to a plane wave propagating along {circumflex over (z)}. Smaller values of <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003" he="3.13mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US08922857-20141230-P00002.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif" orientation="portrait" inline="no"/> yield more finely resolved beams that carry less momentum along {circumflex over (z)}. </p><p>In one embodiment, to create a solenoid beam, the following are set: a(z)=1 and r<sub>0</sub>(z)=R cos(Θ<sub>o</sub>(z)){circumflex over (x)}+R sin(Θ<sub>0</sub>(z))ŷ, where Θ<sub>0</sub>(z)=z/y is the azimuthal angle around the optical axis in a spiral of radius R and pitch γ. In addition to establishing a spiral structure for the beam's principal intensity maximum, a helical phase profile in the plane is imposed, φ(z)=lΘ<sub>0</sub>(z), where the helical pitch, l, is independent of γ. In one embodiment, this helical phase profile will enable the exertion of tunable phase-gradient forces along the solenoid.</p><p>As for the Bessel beam, in one embodiment a non-diffracting solution of Eq. (7) is utilized, such as through integration over all z to obtain:</p><p><maths id="MATH-US-00003" num="00003"><math overflow="scroll"><mtable><mtr><mtd><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>u</mi><mrow><mi>γ</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mi>l</mi><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>γ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mstyle><mspace width="0.3em" height="0.3ex"/></mstyle><mo>⁢</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow><mi>l</mi></munderover><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>l</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow><msup><mi>γ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mfrac><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><msub><mi>J</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>ⅇ</mi><mrow><mi>ⅈ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>l</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow><mi>γ</mi></mfrac><mo>⁢</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></msup><mo>⁢</mo><msup><mi>ⅇ</mi><mrow><mi>ⅈ</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mstyle><mspace width="0.3em" height="0.3ex"/></mstyle><mo>⁢</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mstyle><mspace width="0.3em" height="0.3ex"/></mstyle><mo>⁢</mo><mi>Θ</mi></mrow></msup><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><msub><mi>J</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>m</mi></msub><mo>⁢</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>9</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></maths> <br/> where q<sub>m</sub><sup>2</sup>=k<sup>2</sup>=(l−m)<sup>2</sup>/γ<sup>2 </sup>and where [x] is the integer part of x. The solenoid beam thus is a particular superposition of m-th order Bessel beams. Superposition of non-diffracting modes previously has been used to synthesize multi-lobed spiral and localized modes. More generally, Eq. (9) is a particular example of a rotating scale-invariant electromagnetic field. </p><p>FIG. 1(<i>a</i>) shows the three-dimensional intensity distribution r computed according to Eq. (9) for kR=10, Θ=30° and l=10. As intended, the locus of maximum intensity spirals around the optical axis.</p><p>The intensity distribution of a solenoid depends on z, and so is not strictly invariant under propagation. Nonetheless, the in-plane intensity distribution remains invariant, merely rotating about the optical axis. Such a generalization of the notion of non-diffracting propagation previously was introduced in the context of spiral waves. Solenoid beams therefore may be considered to be non-diffracting in this more general sense.</p><p>In one embodiment, distinct solenoid beams satisfy the orthogonality condition: <br/> <?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>∫<i>u</i><sub>γ′l′*(</sub><i>r,z</i>)<i>u</i><sub>γl</sub>(<i>r,z</i>)<i>d</i><sup>2</sup><i>rdz=δ</i><sub>ll′</sub>δ(γ−γ) (10)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?> <br/> except if m≡(lγ′−l′γ)/(γ′−γ) is an integer that falls in the range [max(l−yk,l′−γ′k)]≦[min(l,l′)]. This additional condition defines classes of m-congruent solenoid beams whose members are not mutually orthogonal and results from the solenoid modes' non-trivial periodicity along the optical axis. </p><p>In one embodiment, the helicity of the solenoid beam is altered to impact the wavefronts and, thus, the direction of particle movement. FIG. 2 shows the effect of changing the helicity of a solenoid beam with a fixed spiral pitch, α=tan<sup>−1</sup>(γk). When l&gt;0, as in FIG. 2(<i>a</i>), the wave vector is directed along the solenoid, i.e., there is a downstream phase-gradient force. A particle confined to the spiral by intensity-gradient forces therefore is driven downstream by this component of the radiation pressure. Changing l does not alter α, but changes the wavefronts' pitch relative to {circumflex over (z)}. As shown in FIG. 2(<i>b</i>), at l=0, the wavefronts are parallel to the solenoid's pitch. In this case, radiation pressure is directed normal to the spiral, and so can be balanced by intensity-gradient forces. Particles trapped by intensity-gradient forces experience no net force. Setting l&lt;0 tilts the wavefronts in the retrograde direction, as shown in FIG. 2(<i>c</i>). The resulting reverse-sense phase-gradient force can move the particle upstream along the spiral in the negative {circumflex over (z)} direction. This condition therefore enables a optical solenoid beam to act as a tractor beam, conveying illuminated material back toward its source.</p><h1>EXAMPLES</h1><p>Solenoid beams were projected using methods developed for holographic optical trapping. In this system, a phase-only liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM) (Hamamatsu X7690-16 PPM) was used to imprint the hologram u<sub>0</sub>(r) associated with u<sub>γ,l</sub>(r) onto the wavefronts of a linearly polarized laser beam with a vacuum wavelength <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00004" he="3.13mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US08922857-20141230-P00003.TIF" alt="custom character" img-content="character" img-format="tif" orientation="portrait" inline="no"/>=532 nm (Coherent Verdi). This hologram then was projected into the far field with a microscope objective lens (Nikon Plan Apo, 100×, oil immersion) mounted in a conventional inverted optical microscope (Nikon TE 2000U). The computed complex hologram was encoded on the phase-only SLM using the shape-phase holography algorithm. The resulting beam included the intended solenoid mode superposed with higher diffraction orders.</p><p>To visualize the projected beam, a front-surface mirror was mounted on the microscope's stage. The reflected light was collected by the objective lens and relayed to a CCD camera (NEC TI-324AII). Images acquired at a sequence of focal depths then were combined to create a volumetric rendering of the three-dimensional intensity field. The example in FIG. 1(<i>b</i>) shows the serpentine structure of a holographically projected solenoid beam with R=5 μm.</p><p>To demonstrate the solenoid beam's ability to exert retrograde forces on microscopic objects, it was projected into a sample of colloidal silica spheres 1.5 μm in diameter dispersed in water. The sample was contained in the 50 μm thick gap between a glass microscope slide and a glass number 1 cover slip, and was mounted on the microscope's stage. Bright-field images of individual spheres interacting with the solenoid beam were obtained with the same objective lens used to project the hologram, and were recorded by the video camera at 1/30 s intervals. The sphere's appearance changes as it moves in z in a manner that can be calibrated to measure the particle's axial position. Combining this with simultaneous measurements of the particle's in-plane position yields the three-dimensional trajectory data that are plotted in FIG. 3. The gray-scale image in FIG. 3 was created by superimposing six snapshots of a single sphere that was trapped on a solenoid beam and moving along its length. This illustrates how the sphere's image changes as it moves in z.</p><p>The data plotted in FIG. 3 were obtained by alternately setting l=+30 and l=−30 without changing any other properties of the solenoid beam. The three blue traces show trajectories obtained with l=+30 in which the particle moved downstream along the curve of the solenoid, advancing in the direction of the light's propagation. These alternate with two red traces obtained with l=−30 in which the particle moves back upstream, opposite to the direction of the light's propagation. These latter traces confirm that the combination of phase—and intensity-gradient forces in helical solenoid beams can exert retrograde forces on illuminated objects and transport them upstream over large distances.</p><p>Although in one embodiment, the solenoid beam was designed to be uniformly bright, the article does not move along it smoothly in practice. Interference between the holographically projected solenoid beam and higher diffraction orders creates unintended intensity variations along the solenoid that tend to localize the particle. These unintended intensity variations may be minimized by designing the hologram to direct the intended solenoid beam away from the direction of the higher-order beams. They also may be minimized using standard methods of adaptive optics to minimize the intensity of higher diffraction orders.</p><p>Although in one embodiment, the solenoid beam was projected using a computer-addressable spatial light modulator, the hologram required to create an optical solenoid beam also may be created with a static diffractive optical element, such as a microfabricated diffractive optical element.</p><p>Although in one preferred embodiment, the solenoid beam is created from a single Gaussian input beam using a single diffractive optical element, an equivalently functional optical solenoid beam can be created according to the prescription of Equation (9) by forming an appropriate superposition of Bessel beams using such conventional optical elements as axicons to create the Bessel beams, and beam splitters to combine them. Other equivalent methods for creating such superpositions of beams are commonly known in the art.</p><p>The foregoing results introduce solenoidal beams of light whose non-diffracting transverse intensity profiles spiral periodically around the optical axis and whose wavefronts can be independently inclined through specified azimuthal phase profiles. Solenoid beams of the present invention can trap microscopic objects in three dimensions and that phase-gradient forces can be used to transport trapped objects not only down the optical axis but also up. The ability to balance radiation pressure with phase-gradient forces in solenoidal beams opens a previously unexplored avenue for single-beam control of microscopic objects. In principle, solenoid beams can transport objects over large distances, much as do Bessel beams and related nondiffracting modes, without the need for high-numerical-aperture optics. Solenoid beams, moreover, offer the additional benefit of bidirectional transport along the optical axis with the direction of transport selected with the choice of the sign of l.</p><p>In one embodiment, shown in FIG. 4, a system <b>100</b> is provided for generating and or controlling solenoid beams as described.

            <?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?><h1>INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</h1><p>The present application claims priority from Japanese application JP2010-289119 filed on Dec. 27, 2010, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.</p><h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1><p>The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for reproducing information from an optical information recording medium, using holography.</p><p>Currently, based on Blu-ray Disc (BD) standard using a blue-violet semiconductor laser, an optical disc having a recording density of as large as 50 GB may be commercialized even for consumer use. In the future, optical discs are desired to provide a large capacity comparable to the capacity of a HDD (hard disc drive) such as 100 GB to 1 TB. However, in order to realize such an optical disc of ultra-high density, a high-density architecture technology of a new system is required which is different from the conventional high-density technology including decreasing the wavelength and making the NA (numerical aperture) ratio of objective lens higher.</p><p>During researches relating to a next-generation storage technology having been made a holographic recording technology recording digital information using holography has been paid to attention. The holographic recording technology is defined such that a signal light having information of page data two-dimensionally modulated by a spatial light modulator is superimposed on a reference light within an optical information recording medium, and a pattern of interference fringes resulting at the superimposition causes a modulation in the refraction index of the optical recording medium to thereby record the information on the optical information recording medium.</p><p>When reproducing the information, the same reference light as used in the recording is irradiated to the optical information recording medium. At this time, a hologram recorded in the optical information recording medium functions like a holographic diffraction grating and so, the same light as the recorded signal light including phase information is reproduced as a diffracted light. The reproduced light is two-dimensionally detected fast using a light detector (photodetector) such as a CMOS or CCD. In this manner, the holographic recording technology allows two-dimensional information to be recorded on the optical light recording medium by once and further the recorded information to be reproduced. In addition, the holographic recording technology allows a plurality of two-dimensional data to be multiplex-recorded on one position of the optical information recording medium, thereby making it possible to achieve recording and reproduction of high-speed and large-capacity information.</p><p>As the holographic recording technology for example, JP-A-2004-272268 is published. This publication discloses a so-called angle-multiplex recording system, in which signal light fluxes are collected on an optical information recording medium by a lens, and at the same time a reference light of parallel fluxes is irradiated on the recording medium to interfere with each other thereby performing holographic recording on the recording medium, and further a different page data is multiplex-recorded with an incident angle of the reference light to the optical information recording medium being changed, by indicating the page data on a spatial light modulator. In addition, the JP-A-2004-272268 discloses collecting the signal light by the lens and arranging the aperture (spatial filter) to the beam waist of the collected light, so that the spacing between adjacent holograms may be made shorter to thereby increase the recording density and the storage capacity of the recording medium compared with the prior art angle-multiplex recording system.</p><p>For another holographic recording technology, for example, WO2004-102542 is published. This publication discloses an example using a shift multiplex system in which in one spatial light modulator, light from an inner pixel is used as a signal light, and light from an outer pixel is used as a reference light, both fluxes are collected on the optical information recording medium by the same lens, and the signal light and the reference light are subjected to interference around a focal plane of the lens to thereby record the hologram.</p><p>As an equalizing technology in hologram reproduction, for example, JP-A-2006-267539 is published. This publication discloses an art in which in order to effectively remove intersymbol interference which an attention pixel receives from the surrounding pixels filter coefficients are selected based on a binarized-data pattern by which a temporal determination is made.</p><h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1><p>In a two-dimensional data called “a page which is reproduced from a hologram” there is a problem to be solved that the aspect of intersymbol interference is different depending upon the position within the page to make the quality of reproduction different within the page.</p><p>To solve the above-mentioned problem, a page-adaptive equalizing processing of making the filter coefficient adaptive for a different page has been conventionally reported. However, the equalizing processing still has a problem that since one filter coefficient is calculated from one page, it is difficult to satisfactorily cope with the difference in the intersymbol interference within the same page. According to the equalizing processing disclosed in JP-A-2006-267539 the filter coefficient is changed depending upon the condition of the adjacent pixels, and the filter coefficient is determined only by the ON/OFF state of the adjacent pixels. However, the prior art publication inherently has not taken into consideration the difference of the intersymbol interference within the page and so, is difficult to successfully solve the above-mentioned problem, like the conventional approach.</p><p>The object of the present invention is to perform an equalizing processing adaptive for the difference of the quality of reproduction depending upon the position within a reproduced page to thereby improve the signal quality of the entire page.</p><p>The object of the present invention is solved by as one example, in reproducing a two-dimensional page data from an optical information recording medium, dividing the reproduced two-dimensional page data into a plurality of areas, adaptively equalizing the divided two-dimensional areas individually, and coupling the adaptively equalized two-dimensional areas so as to restore the condition of the original two-dimensional page data.</p><p>According to the present invention, a page is divided into a plurality of areas and is adaptively equalized, so that the difference in the aspect of intersymbol interference depending upon the position within the same page can be effectively removed.</p><p>Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><h1>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</h1><p>FIG. 1 is a constructional block diagram of an optical information recording and reproducing apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p><p>FIG. 2 is an illustration showing an embodiment of a pickup within the optical information recording and reproducing apparatus (when recording).</p><p>FIG. 3 is an illustration showing an embodiment of a pickup within the optical information recording and reproducing apparatus (when reproducing).</p><p>FIGS. 4A to 4C are flow diagrams showing an embodiment of operation flow of the optical information recording and reproducing apparatus, respectively.</p><p>FIG. 5 is illustrations showing the difference in the quality of reproduction within the same page by way of example.</p><p>FIG. 6A is an illustration showing one example of an area subjected to filtering.

FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing an optical information recording and reproducing apparatus which records and/or reproduces digital information utilizing holography.</p><p>An optical information recording and reproducing apparatus <b>10</b> includes a pickup <b>11</b>, a phase conjugate optical system <b>12</b>, a disc Cure optical system <b>13</b>, a disc rotating angle detecting optical system <b>14</b> and a rotating motor <b>50</b>. An optical information recording medium <b>1</b> is configured to be rotatable by the rotating motor <b>50</b>.</p><p>The pickup <b>11</b> plays a role to emit a reference light and a signal light to the optical information recording medium <b>1</b> and record digital information on the recording medium <b>1</b> utilizing holography. At this time, the recorded digital information signal is sent to a spatial light modulator within the pickup <b>11</b> by a controller <b>89</b> through a signal generating circuit <b>86</b>, and then the signal light is modulated by the spatial light modulator.</p><p>When reproducing information recorded on the optical information recording medium <b>1</b> a phase conjugate light of a reference light emitted from the pickup <b>11</b> is generated in the phase conjugate optical system <b>12</b>. Here, the phase conjugate light is defined to be a light wave which propagates in the direction opposite to that of an input light with the same plane as the input light being kept. A reproduced light reproduced by the phase conjugate light is detected by a light detector referred to hereafter and provided within the pickup <b>11</b>, and then a signal is reproduced by a signal processing circuit <b>85</b> from the detected light.</p><p>The irradiating time for irradiating reference light and signal light to the optical information recording medium <b>1</b> may be adjusted by controlling the on/off time of a shutter within the pickup <b>11</b> by the controller <b>89</b> through a shutter controlling circuit <b>87</b>.</p><p>The disc cure optical system <b>13</b> plays a role to generate a light beam used for pre-cure and post-cure of optical information recording medium <b>1</b>. The pre-cure is defined as a pre-process of irradiating, when recording information on a desired position within optical information recording medium <b>1</b>, the desired position with a predetermined light beam before irradiating the desired position with reference light and signal light. The post-cure is defined as a post-process of irradiating a desired position within optical information recording medium <b>1</b> with a predetermined light beam in order to prevent overwriting on the desired position after recording information thereon.</p><p>The disc rotating angle detecting optical system <b>14</b> is used to detect a rotating angle of optical information recording medium <b>1</b>. When adjusting the optical information recording medium <b>1</b> at a predetermined rotating angle the disc rotating angle detecting optical system <b>14</b> detects a signal corresponding to the rotating angle, and the controller <b>89</b> can control the rotating angle of the recording medium <b>1</b> through a disc rotating motor controlling circuit <b>88</b> using the detected signal.</p><p>A light source drive circuit <b>82</b> feeds a predetermined light source driving current to light sources within the pickup <b>11</b>, the disc cure optical system <b>13</b> and the disc rotating angle optical system <b>14</b>. Each of the light sources is capable of emitting a light beam with a predetermined light quantity.</p><p>The pickup <b>11</b> and the disc cure optical system <b>13</b> are provided with a mechanism which makes them slidable in position in the radial direction of the optical information recording medium <b>1</b>, so that the position control may be performed through an access control circuit <b>81</b>.</p><p>Recording technology utilizing the principle of angle multiplexing of holography tends to make considerably small the permissible error to a difference in the reference light angle.</p><p>It is therefore required to provide a mechanism for detecting the quantity of difference of the reference light angle within the pickup <b>11</b> and a servo mechanism associated therewith in the optical information recording and reproducing apparatus in which a servo signal generating circuit <b>83</b> generates a signal for servo control to thereby correct the quantity of difference through a servo controlling circuit <b>84</b>.</p><p>The pickup <b>11</b>, the disc cure optical system <b>13</b> and the disc rotating angle detecting optical system <b>14</b> may be simplified such that some or whole of them are configured by one optical system.</p><p>FIG. 2 shows a recording principle in an example of a basic optical system configuration of pickup <b>11</b> in the optical information recording and reproducing apparatus <b>10</b>. A light beam emitted from a light source <b>201</b> passes through a collimated lens <b>202</b> into a shutter <b>203</b>. When the shutter <b>203</b> is open the light beam having passed through the shutter <b>203</b> is controlled relative to polarizing direction by an optical element <b>204</b> formed of, for example, a ½ wavelength plate such that the ratio in light quantity between p-polarization and s-polarization may be a predetermined ratio, and then enters a PBS (Polarization Beam Splitter) prism <b>205</b>.</p><p>The light beam having passed through the PBS prism <b>205</b> serves as a signal light <b>206</b>, the light beam is diametrically expanded by a beam expander <b>208</b>, is passed through a phase mask <b>209</b>, a relay lens <b>210</b> and a PBS prism <b>211</b>, and enters a spatial light modulator <b>212</b>.</p><p>The signal light to which information is added by the spatial light modulator <b>212</b> is reflected in the PBS prism <b>211</b>, and propagates in the relay lens <b>213</b> and a spatial filter <b>214</b>. Thereafter, the signal light is collected on the optical information recording medium <b>1</b> by an objective lens <b>215</b>.</p><p>On the other hand, the light beam reflected in the PBS prism <b>205</b> serves as a reference light <b>207</b>, is set in a polarized direction predetermined according to recording or reproducing by a polarizing direction converting element <b>216</b>, and then is passed through a mirror <b>217</b> and a mirror <b>218</b> into a galvanic-mirror <b>219</b>. The galvanic-mirror <b>219</b> can be adjusted in its angle by an actuator <b>220</b>, so that the reference light incident on the optical information recording medium <b>1</b> after passed through a lens <b>221</b> and a lens <b>222</b> can be set in a desired incident angle. Here, in order to set the incident angle of the reference light, an element for converting the wave-front of reference light may be used in pace of the galvanic-mirror.</p><p>In this manner, the signal light and the reference light are entered to be superimposed on each other in optical information recording medium <b>1</b>, so that a pattern of interference fringes is formed within the optical information recording medium <b>1</b>. This pattern is written into the optical information recording medium to thus record information. The galvanic-mirror <b>219</b> can change the incident angle of reference light incident on the optical information recording medium <b>1</b>, thus making it possible to provide angle-multiplexing recording.</p><p>Hereafter, in holograms recorded on the same area by changing the angle of reference light, a hologram corresponding to a different angle of reference light is referred to as a “page” and a set of pages angle-multiplexed on the same area is referred to as a “book”.</p><p>FIG. 3 shows a reproducing principle in an example of a basic optical system configuration of pickup <b>11</b> in the optical information recording and reproducing apparatus <b>10</b>. When reproducing recorded information a reference light is entered to the optical information recording medium <b>1</b> as mentioned above, a light beam passed through the recording medium <b>1</b> is reflected by a galvanic-mirror <b>224</b> capable of adjusting its angle by an actuator <b>223</b> to generate a phase conjugate light thereof.</p><p>A signal light reproduced by the phase conjugate light propagates through the objective lens <b>215</b>, the relay lens <b>213</b> and the spatial filter <b>214</b>. After then, the signal light passes through the PBS prism <b>211</b> and enters a light detector <b>225</b> to allow the recorded signal to be reproduced.</p><p>FIGS. 4A-4C show operation flows of recording and reproduction in optical information recording and reproducing apparatus <b>10</b>. Particularly, flows concerning recording and reproduction utilizing holography will be described here.</p><p>FIG. 4A shows an operation flow of from loading of the optical information recording medium <b>1</b> on the optical information recording and reproducing apparatus <b>10</b> to completion of preparation of recording or reproducing. FIG. 4B shows an operation flow of from the condition of the preparation completion to information recording into the optical information recording medium <b>1</b>, and FIG. 4C shows an operation flow of from the condition of the preparation completion to reproducing of recorded information on the optical information recording medium <b>1</b>.</p><p>When the recording medium is loaded on the optical information recording and reproducing apparatus <b>10</b> (S<b>401</b>) as shown in FIG. 4A, the apparatus <b>10</b> discriminates a disc as the medium as to whether, for example, the loaded medium is a medium for recording or reproducing digital information utilizing holography (S<b>402</b>).</p><p>As a result of disc discrimination, if it is determined that the medium is the optical information recording medium for recording or reproducing digital information utilizing holography, the optical information recording and reproducing apparatus <b>10</b> reproduces control data provided in the optical information recording medium (S<b>403</b>), and acquires, for example, information concerning the optical information recording medium and information concerning different kinds of setting conditions at the time of recording or reproduction.</p><p>After the control data is reproduced different kinds of adjustments responsive to the control data and a learning processing relating to pickup <b>11</b> are performed (S<b>404</b>). The optical information recording and reproducing apparatus <b>10</b> completes the preparation of recording or reproducing (S<b>405</b>).</p><p>As the operation flow of from the preparation completion condition to recording of information is shown in FIG. 4B, first of all, a data to be recorded is received (S<b>411</b>), and information corresponding to the data is sent to the spatial light modulator within pickup <b>11</b>.</p><p>Thereafter, in order to record information of high quality on an optical information recording medium different kinds of learning processing is previously performed when required, (S<b>412</b>), and the pickup <b>11</b> and disc cure optical system <b>13</b> are positioned at predetermined positions of the optical information recording medium by a seek operation (S<b>413</b>).</p><p>After then using a light beam emitted from the disc cure optical system <b>13</b> a predetermined area is pre-cured, (S<b>414</b>), and using a reference light and a signal light emitted from the pickup <b>11</b> a data is recorded (S<b>415</b>).</p><p>After the data is recorded the data is verified when required (S<b>416</b>) and a post cure is performed (S<b>417</b>) using a light beam emitted from the disc cure optical system <b>13</b>.</p><p>As the operation flow of from the preparation completion condition to reproduction of recorded information is shown in FIG. 4C, in order to reproduce information of high quality from the optical information recording medium different kinds of learning processing is previously performed when required (S<b>421</b>). Then, the pickup <b>11</b> and phase conjugate optical system <b>12</b> are positioned at predetermined positions of the optical information recording medium by a seek operation (S<b>422</b>).</p><p>After then the reference light is emitted from the pickup <b>11</b>, and thereby information recorded in the optical information recording medium is reproduced (S<b>423</b>). The present invention is applied as means for enhancing the quality of signal in reproducing the information.</p><p>Detailed description of embodiments of the present invention will be made in the following.</p><h1>Embodiment 1</h1><p>Description of the outline will be made on the validity of dividing a page into a plurality of areas and performing adaptive equalizing to every divided area. FIG. 5 schematically shows the difference in reproduction quality depending upon the positional difference within the same page. In illustrations (a) of FIG. 5, when black-colored OFF pixels surround a white-colored ON pixel as shown in an upper-side illustration (a) of the Figure, a spatial light modulator in recording indicates the ON pixel and the OFF pixels adjacent thereto in the form of binary signal as shown in a lower-side illustration (a) of FIG. 5. However, when recording the signal on an optical information recording medium in the form of a hologram and looking at a reproduction signal from the recorded signal, it is found that an intersymbol interference occurs due to leakage of the signal into the adjacent OFF pixels from the ON pixel, as shown in an upper-side illustration (b) of FIG. 5. This is because the aperture (spatial filter) shrinking the waist of the beam described in JP-A-2004-272268 eliminates high-frequency components, where the smaller the size of the aperture is, the larger the intersymbol interference becomes.</p><p>The above-mentioned intersymbol interference may change the state of the interference depending upon the position within the page due to external complex disturbances, such as aberration of lens, wavelength difference of laser or disc-tilt or the like. When a page reproduced from a certain hologram is divided into five areas as shown in illustration (c) of FIG. 5, and the difference in leakage of ON pixel into OFF pixels adjacent thereto is observed for each divided page area, it is found that the state of the interference is different depending upon the positional difference within the page as shown in the lower-side illustration (b) of FIG. 5. Thus, it is difficult to satisfactorily cope with the difference in the intersymbol interference within the same page, by the prior art page-adaptive equalizing in which one filter coefficient is determined to one page. By contrast, the present invention is effective and valid in which one page is divided into plural areas and each divided area is subjected to adaptive equalization.</p><p>FIGS. 6A and 6B show an example of FIR filter processing for two-dimensional pixels. As shown in, for example, FIG. 6A, let us consider to process, by filtering, the luminance value of a pixel of interest (hereinafter referred to as “attention pixel”) centrally located in 3×3 areas to be filtered. In the filtering process, as shown in FIG. 6B, the respective luminance values of the attention pixel and the adjacent pixels 1-8 are multiplied by filter coefficients using multiplier circuits <b>301</b> to <b>309</b>, and all multiplied luminance values are summed up by an adder circuit <b>310</b> to thereby calculate the luminance value after filtering. It is natural that when the 3×3 areas are assumed to be filtered nine filter coefficients are required in value. It is to be noted that the present invention should not be limited to 3×3 filter areas and any number of filter areas may be used.</p><p>FIG. 7 shows an example of a method for dividing a page in accordance with Embodiment 1. When a reproduced page as shown in, for example, illustration (a) of FIG. 7 is acquired, the reproduced page is divided into a plurality of areas (or a group of divided areas) each of which has a size as indicated by a bold frame. Thereafter, a filter coefficient for each divided area is calculated using an adaptive algorithm such as LMMMSE (Linear Minimum Means Squared Error) method (illustration (b) in FIG. 7), and each divided area is subjected to an equalizing processing. In the equalizing processing, in order to realize an efficient equalizing performance even in an edge portion of each area several extra pixels may be subjected to filter processing and relevant ones of the processed pixels may be extracted as areas after equalized. In this embodiment, though 16-divided areas are shown the present invention is not limited to the 16-divided areas. Further, though each divided area is shown to have the same size the size of the divided area may be changed.</p><p>Description will be made of the LMMSE algorithm. As described in a non-patent literature: “Japanese Journal of Applied Physics Vol. 45, No. 2B, 2006, pp. 1079-1083” the LMMSE is an algorithm which calculates a factor coefficient at which the means squared error between equalized signal and ideal signal is minimum. The calculation equation is expressed by Expression (1): <br/> <?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>w=RdiRii</i><sup>−1</sup> (1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?> <br/> where w indicates a filter coefficient determinable by LMMSE, R d i indicates correlation between input pixel and ideal pixel, and R i i indicates autocorrelation of input pixel. Algorithm other than LMMSE may be used as the adaptive algorithm. </p><p>FIG. 8 shows an example of an operation in which a page is divided into a plurality of areas and each divided area is subjected to adaptive equalizing. At step <b>301</b>, a page reproduced from the optical information recording medium is at first divided into a plurality of areas each having a certain size. After then, at step <b>302</b> an adaptive algorithm such as LMMSE is applied to every divided area to calculate the filter coefficient of the divided area. At step <b>303</b>, each divided area is subjected to equalizing processing using the filter coefficients of the respective area determined by step <b>302</b>. At step <b>304</b>, the divided areas are rearranged at the positions before the dividing and are coupled with each other so as to restore the same condition of the page as before the dividing, thereby making page data. At step <b>306</b>, it is determined whether the page under processing is last or not. When it is the last page, the processing is ended, and when not the last page, at step <b>305</b>, the processing proceeds to the next page to execute the operation from the step <b>301</b>. FIG. 8 exemplifies that the filter processing is performed after all of filter coefficients for every divided area have been calculated. Alternatively, the operation of determining a filter coefficient for each divided area and following a filter processing thereto may be performed to all of the divided areas.</p><p>Subsequently, FIG. 9 shows the configuration of an apparatus according to Embodiment 1. A page data detected by the pickup <b>11</b> is adjusted to correct a position difference or the like through a page positioning (alignment) circuit <b>351</b>. The amount of position difference is calculated based on a known pattern embedded within the page, and so, the position differences in the horizontal direction and in the vertical direction, the rotation difference and the magnification difference are calculated. The page positioning circuit <b>351</b> positions a detected image based on the calculated information of such differences. Thereafter, an over-sampling release circuit <b>352</b> adjusts one pixel within the page such that the one pixel and either of ON signal or OFF signal in the spatial light modulator <b>212</b> in recording may have one-to-one corresponding relation. This is because in order to secure sufficient performance of reproduction even though there is a position difference in the page, the resolution of the light detector <b>225</b> is made generally higher than that of the spatial light modulator <b>212</b>. After that, a page dividing circuit <b>353</b> divides the page into a plurality of divided areas each having a certain size and a filter coefficient operating circuit <b>356</b> determines a filter coefficient to every divided area. Further, since the filter coefficient operating circuit <b>356</b> requires an ideal signal, the output of the page dividing circuit <b>353</b> is at the same time transferred to an equalizing circuit <b>354</b> for equalizing processing and is then binarized by a binarizing circuit <b>355</b> and transferred to the filter coefficient operating circuit <b>356</b> as the ideal signal. Further, the binarizing circuit <b>355</b> may determine ON and OFF in accordance with a threshold, utilize the Vitabi decoding, or perform binarizing by soft determination decoding of error correction code such as SUM-PRODUCT decoding. When this embodiment is used as a PR equalizer PRML (Partial Response Maximum Likelihood), the binarizing circuit <b>355</b> may be followed by a filter which performs convolution so as to provide a desired PR characteristic. A variable FIR filter <b>357</b> applies filter processing to the respective divided areas using filter coefficients calculated by the filter coefficient operating circuit <b>356</b>. Thereafter, a page coupling circuit <b>358</b> makes the divided areas couple with each other to restore the condition of the initial page, and a binarizing circuit <b>358</b> binarizes the coupled areas into ON and OFF information and transfers the information to the controller <b>89</b>. In this embodiment, the signal from the binarizing circuit <b>355</b> is used as the ideal signal for the filter coefficient operating circuit. Alternatively, however, the filter coefficients may be operated using the above-mentioned known pattern embedded into the page. The binarizing circuit <b>358</b> may determine ON and OFF according to the threshold like the binarizing circuit <b>355</b>, utilize the Vitabi decoding, or perform binarizing by soft determination/decoding of error correction code such as SUM-PRODUCT decoding.</p><p>According to this embodiment, it is possible to cope with the difference in reproduction quality and intersymbol interference due to the difference in position within the page, so improving the reproduction quality of the overall page. Parallel processing of adaptive equalizing to the respective divided areas allows high-speed signal reproduction. In this embodiment, though the description has been made based on angle-multiplex holography, the present invention should not be limited to the angle-multiplex system, but the present invention may apply to other hologram recording such as a shift multiplex system and signal processing in an optical information recording medium other than hologram.</p><h1>Embodiment 2</h1><p>The description common to that of Embodiment 1 will be omitted hereafter. FIGS. 10A and 10B show an example of a method for dividing a page according to the second embodiment. Like the Embodiment 1 a page is divided into a plurality of areas each having a certain size. The areas which are close in quality with each other are coupled as shown in FIG. 10A to thereby expand the area. The signal quality of the expanded area can be considered as SNR expressed by the following Expression (2) or Expression (3) or the mean luminance, for example. <br/> <?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>SNR</i>=(μON+μOFF)/(σON+σOFF) (2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?> <br/> <?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>SNR</i>=(μON+μOFF)/(σON<sup>2</sup>+σOFF<sup>2</sup>)<sup>0.5</sup> (3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?> <br/> where μON and μOFF represent mean luminances of ON pixel and OFF pixel, respectively, and σON and σOFF represent the standard deviations of ON pixel and OFF pixel, respectively. In this embodiment, if areas are similar in signal quality to each other there is a possibility that the areas are coupled even when are not adjacent to each other. For this reason, there is a possibility that the error in the signal quality increases in quantity due to influence of connecting portions between the coupled areas. However, since the occupation ratio of the connecting portion to the expanded area is small, the error quantity is not so problematic in view of the LMMSE algorithm characteristic which provides a minimum mean squared error. To reduce the error quantity it may be considered to use a method of collecting symmetrical areas based on positional information within the page or another method of collecting areas which are simply close in position to each other as shown in FIG. 10B. </p><p>FIG. 11 shows one example of the operation flow in Embodiment 2. At step <b>401</b>, a page is divided into a plurality of areas each having a certain size. After then, at step <b>402</b>, areas which are close in reproduction quality are coupled based on information such as SNR and mean luminance to thereby expand the area for filter coefficient calculation. At step <b>403</b>, filter coefficients are calculated to every divided area using an algorithm such as LMMSE or the like. At step <b>404</b>, FIR filter processing is performed to every divided area. At step <b>405</b>, the area coupled at step <b>402</b> is re-divided into a set of areas. At step <b>406</b>, the set of divided areas are rearranged and coupled in positions before divided so as to restore the condition of page before dividing to thereby make the page in form of data. At step <b>407</b>, it is determined whether the page under processing is last one. When it is the last page, the processing is terminated. When not the last page, at step <b>408</b> the processing is moved to the next page and the operations from step <b>401</b> are executed.</p><p>FIG. 12 shows one example of the configuration of an apparatus according to the second embodiment. The description of portions common to Embodiment 1 will be omitted. In Embodiment 2, after a page is divided into a plurality of areas by the page dividing circuit <b>353</b> ones of the divided areas which are close in signal quality are coupled by a page coupling circuit <b>360</b>. After then, through the apparatus configuration similar to Embodiment 1 a page dividing circuit <b>361</b> is arranged subsequent to the variable FIR filter <b>357</b> to thereby restore the condition of divided areas before the coupling by the page coupling circuit <b>360</b>. The divided areas are coupled by the page coupling circuit <b>359</b> so as to restore in the condition of the original page. When processed so as to collect divided areas which are close in position information within page the page dividing circuit <b>361</b> can be omitted if the page coupling circuit <b>359</b> can restore the page without the page dividing circuit <b>361</b>. Like Embodiment 1, when using the apparatus as a PR equalizer of Partial Response Maximum Likelihood (PRML) the binarizing circuit <b>355</b> may be followed by a filter for performing convolution so as to provide a desired PR characteristic.</p><p>According to Embodiment 2, in addition to the merits described in Embodiment 1, it is possible to calculate filter coefficients which are higher in precision because divided areas which are close in signal quality are collected to thereby increase the number of samples in determination of one filter coefficient. Since the number of filter coefficients may be reduced it is possible to reduce the circuit scale compared with Embodiment 1 if collected as such.</p><h1>Embodiment 3</h1><p>FIG. 13 shows one example of operation flow according to the third embodiment directed to a method for adaptively equalizing every divided area. In Embodiment 3, after one filter coefficient is calculated from the overall pages the filter coefficient is modified so that it may be the coefficient for every divided area and the modified coefficient is equalized for every divided area. At step <b>501</b>, one modified filter coefficient is calculated from the overall pages using an adaptive algorithm such as LMMSE or the like. Then, at step <b>502</b>, the page is divided into a plurality of areas each having a certain size. At step <b>503</b>, the processing proceeds to a known pattern within the divided area. This known pattern may be the known pattern for calculating the quantity of difference described in Embodiment 1, or may be a known pattern for determining a filter coefficient newly embedded into the page. At step <b>504</b>, using the filter coefficient calculated at step <b>501</b> as an initial value the filter coefficients are modified by the LMS algorithm or the like so as to be filter coefficients for effectively removing intersymbol interference for each divided area. At step <b>505</b>, every divided area is subjected to a FIR filter processing, and at step <b>506</b>, it is determined whether the filter processing is for the last dived area. If not so, at step <b>507</b>, the processing proceeds to the next divided area to return to the processing from step <b>503</b>. If the filter processing is for the last divided area, at step <b>508</b>, the divided areas are rearranged and coupled in positions thereof before the dividing so as to restore the same condition of the page as before dividing, thus making the page in the form of data. At step <b>509</b>, it is determined whether the processing is for the last page. If yes, the processing is terminated. If otherwise, the processing proceeds to the subsequent page, to which the operations beginning at step <b>501</b> are repeated.</p><p>FIG. 14 shows an example of the sequence for updating the filter coefficients by the LMS algorithm. The filter coefficients may be updated by sequentially reading the known portion vertically as shown in illustration (a) of FIG. 14. The updating may be done by sequentially reading the known portion horizontally as shown in illustration (b) of FIG. 14. As the alternative, the filter coefficients may be updated by reading from an outer circumferential portion to the center portion or reversely from the center portion to the outer circumferential portion as shown in illustration (c) of FIG. 14. According to the LMS algorithm, the filter coefficient is updated using the following Expression (4): <br/> <?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>w</i>(<i>n+</i>1)=<i>w</i>(<i>n</i>)+μ<i>e</i>(<i>n</i>)<i>i</i>(<i>n</i>) (4)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?> <br/> where w (n+1) represents a (n+1)-th filter coefficient, w (n) represents an n-th filter coefficient, μ represents a step-size parameter, e (n) represents the error between the signal equalized with n-th filter coefficient and the ideal signal, and i (n) represents an input applied to the n-th filter circuit. </p><p>FIG. 15 shows one example of the configuration of an apparatus according to Embodiment 3. The description of portions common to Embodiment 1 will be omitted hereafter. The over-sampling release circuit <b>352</b> is followed by the filter coefficient operating circuit <b>356</b> to thereby calculate filter coefficients from the whole page. At this time, since the filter coefficient operating circuit <b>356</b> requires an ideal signal the equalizing circuit <b>354</b> equalizes the filter coefficient and the binarizing circuit <b>355</b> binarizes the equalized filter coefficient to thereby provide the ideal signal. The page dividing circuit <b>353</b> divides a signal from the over-sampling circuit <b>352</b> into areas each having a certain size. Then an image extracting circuit <b>364</b> extracts a known portion within each divided area. The variable FIR filter <b>357</b> applies filter processing to the extracted known portion. The output of the filter coefficient operating circuit <b>356</b> is used as the initial value of the filter coefficient. An error calculating circuit <b>365</b> compares an actual value of the known portion received from the controller <b>89</b> with the output of the variable FIR filter <b>357</b> to calculate the quantity of error. After then a filter coefficient operating circuit <b>366</b> updates the filter coefficient using the above-mentioned LMS algorithm. This processing is done over all pixels of the known portion, and thereby the filter coefficients are updated so as to become filter coefficients for every divided area one after another. Over all of the divided areas, the like processing is applied to calculate filter coefficients for every divided area, using the calculated filter coefficients for every divided area the variable FIR filter <b>367</b> subjects to filter processing every divided area of a page divided into a plurality of areas by the page dividing circuit <b>353</b>, and the page coupling circuit <b>359</b> couples the divided areas after filter processing so as to restore the initial condition of the page. Finally, the binarizing circuit <b>358</b> binarizes the restored page and transfers the binarized restored page to the controller <b>89</b>. Further, when like Embodiment 1 the apparatus is used as a PR equalizer for Partial response Maximum Likelihood (PRML) a filter which performs convolution so as to provide a desired PR characteristic may be provided between the controller <b>89</b> and the error calculating circuit <b>365</b> and subsequent to the binarzing circuit <b>355</b>. An initial value in updating the filter coefficient by LMS may be the filter coefficient calculated by the overall page, as previously mentioned. In divided areas considered to have a similar characteristic, a filter coefficient updated by LMS may be used as the initial value.</p><p>According to Embodiment 3 in addition to the merits and advantages as described in Embodiment 1, since the filter coefficients are calculated using a known portion no error is included in the ideal signal in the adaptive algorithm, and therefore, it will be possible to calculate filter coefficients which are high in precision.</p><h1>Embodiment 4</h1><p>FIG. 16 schematically illustrates the fourth embodiment directed to a method of adaptively equalizing every divided area. In Embodiment 4, known pages for calculating filter coefficients are sandwiched in the beginning of a book and between data pages periodically, filter coefficients for every divided area are calculated from the known pages using either one of the methods described in Embodiments 1 to 3. With reference to the equalizing processing in data pages, filter coefficients determined from the known pages are used as they are, and are subjected to filter processing for every divided area. FIG. 16 exemplifies that two known pages are sandwiched within one book. However, the frequency of known page sandwiching is arbitrary and is not limited to the example method of FIG. 16.</p><p>FIG. 17 shows one example of operation flow according to Embodiment 4. At step <b>601</b>, a page is divided into a plurality of areas each having a certain size. At step <b>602</b>, it is determined whether a page under processing is a known page or not. If yes, at step <b>607</b>, filter coefficients are calculated for every divided area, and at step <b>608</b>, the processing proceeds to the next page to return to step <b>601</b>. Further, the determination as to whether a page under processing is a known page may be made based on the number of page or information indicating that the page is a known page and that is previously embedded into the page. At step <b>602</b>, if the determination is otherwise, at step <b>603</b> and step <b>604</b>, every divided area is subjected to filter processing using the filter coefficients determined for the known page. At step <b>605</b>, the divided areas are rearranged and coupled in positions before the dividing so as to restore the same condition of page as before the dividing, thus making the page in the form of data. At step <b>606</b>, it is determined whether the page under processing is the last page. If yes, the processing is terminated. If otherwise, at step <b>609</b>, the processing proceeds to the next page, and the execution of operation from step <b>601</b> is repeated.</p><p>FIG. 18 shows one example of the configuration of an apparatus according to Embodiment 4. The description of portions similar to those of Embodiment 1 will be omitted hereafter. A known page determining circuit <b>368</b> subsequent to the over-sampling release circuit <b>352</b> determines whether a page under processing is a known page. After then, the page dividing circuit <b>353</b> divides the page into a set of divided areas each of which has a certain size. If the page under processing is the known page in the determination the filter coefficient operating circuit <b>356</b> calculates a set of filter coefficients for every divided area. The ideal signal in this case is provided by the controller <b>89</b>. If the page under processing is not the known page, the variable FIR filter <b>357</b> subjects the page to filter processing using a set of filter coefficients calculated by the filter coefficient operating circuit <b>356</b> based on the known page. After then, the page coupling circuit <b>359</b> couples the divided areas so as to restore the initial condition of the page. The binarizing circuit <b>358</b> binarizes the coupled divided areas and transfers binarized page data to the controller <b>89</b>.</p><p>According to Embodiment 4, in addition to the merits and advantages described in Embodiment 1, a set of filter coefficients are calculated using the known portion like Embodiment 3 and further the known portion is rather numerous in sampling number and page number, so that it is possible to calculate filter coefficients which are higher in precision than the Embodiment 3. In this embodiment, the adaptive algorithm is not applied to all pages for execution, but it is applied to only the known pages, so that the reproduction can be speeded up as compared with the other embodiments.</p><p>It should be further understood by those skilled in the art that although the foregoing description has been made on embodiments of the invention, the invention is not limited thereto and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.</p><?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?>        </div>

            A Head Up Display can be utilized to find light from an energy source. The Head Up Display includes a first waveguide having a first input coupler and a first output coupler. The Head Up Display can also include a second waveguide having a second input coupler and a second output coupler. The first waveguide has a first major surface and the second waveguide has a second major surface, which are disposed approximately parallel to each other. The first waveguide and the second waveguide are positioned as a combiner and allowing viewing an outside feed and information from an image source. The first input coupler diffracts light in the first field of view into the first waveguide and light in a second field of view reaches the second input coupler and is diffracted into the second waveguide.         </div>

No. 13/250,621, entitled, “System for and Method of Catadioptric Collimation in a Compact Head Up Display (HUD),” filed on an even date herewith, incorporated herein by reference herein in its entirety and assigned to the assignee of the present application.</p><h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1><p>The present specification relates to displays. More particularly, the present specification relates to head up displays (HUDs).</p><p>Conventional HUDs are generally large, expensive and difficult to fit into small airplanes. Often, conventional HUDs rely on large lenses to form adequate field of view and viewing eye box. Compact HUDs are needed for small business jets and other aircraft where space is constrained in the cockpit.</p><p>Substrate guided HUDs have been proposed which use waveguide technology with diffraction gratings to preserve eye box size while reducing lens size. U.S. Pat. No. 4,309,070 issued to St. Leger Searle and U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,512 issued to Upatnieks disclose substrate waveguide HUDS where the pupil of a collimating optical system is effectively expanded by the waveguide structure. However, such systems have faced difficulties in design. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,711,512 teaches the use of diffraction gratings based upon holographic materials which can be difficult to process consistently. Holograms are generally extremely angle-sensitive and wavelength-sensitive because they rely on low index modulation throughout a thick volume (Δn&lt;0.05), where the required phase shift for diffraction can only be met for a small set of wavelengths and angles. Diffraction gratings fabricated using embossing and casting processes are more repeatable but can be limited to organic low refractive index materials, thereby limiting the field of view and spectral range. Diffraction gratings that have mechanically reproduced gratings (ruled gratings) often do not achieve the required resolution for HUD applications. Diffraction gratings implemented using a surface relief geometry provide favorable characteristics compared to the aforementioned types.</p><p>Substrate guided HUDs achieve a large eyebox size while reducing the collimating lens size by an affect called pupil expansion. Light from the collimating optics pupil is coupled into the waveguide substrate by a first surface relief diffraction grating. The pupil expansion effect comes about by using a relatively weak (low diffraction efficiency) second surface relief diffraction grating with a larger extent in the desired expansion direction compared to the first grating, so that light propagating within the waveguide interacts many times with the second diffraction grating, gradually coupling out along the length of the waveguide and effectively creating an expansion of the collimating optics pupil. The gradual out-coupling action means that at each subsequent interaction with the second diffraction grating there is less light available compared to the previous interaction, so the expanded pupil luminance becomes lower and lower along the length of the second diffraction grating. This luminance decrease is manifested as a luminance non-uniformity in the displayed HUD image. Therefore, there is a need for a means of balancing the expanded pupil luminance along the length of the surface relief out-coupling diffraction grating.</p><h1>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</h1><p>An exemplary embodiment relates to a head up display for providing light from an image source. The head up display includes a first waveguide having a first input coupler and a first output coupler. The head up display also includes a second waveguide having a second input coupler and a second output coupler. The first waveguide has a first major surface and the second waveguide has a second major surface. The first major surface is disposed approximately parallel to the second major surface. The first waveguide and the second waveguide are positioned as a combiner and allow viewing of an outside scene and information from the image source. The first input coupler diffracts light in a first field of view into the first waveguide. Light in a second field of view reaches the second input coupler and is diffracted into the second waveguide.</p><p>Another exemplary embodiment relates to a method of providing information to a pilot. The method includes diffracting first light from light associated with the information into a first waveguide. The first light is associated with a first field of view range. The method also includes diffracting second light from the light associated with the information into a second waveguide. The second light being associated with a second field of view range. The method further includes providing the first light out of the first waveguide and the second light out of the second waveguide. The first and second waveguides are configured as a combiner for providing the information to the pilot and allowing viewing of the real world scene.</p><p>Another exemplary embodiment relates to an optical system for a head up display. The optical system includes a combiner. The combiner includes a first waveguide and a second waveguide.

Accordingly, the structure, methods, functions, control and arrangement of components have been illustrated in the drawings by readily understandable block representations and schematic drawings, in order not to obscure the disclosure with structural details which will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, having the benefit of the description herein. Further, the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments depicted in the exemplary diagrams, but should be construed in accordance with the language in the claims.</p><p>With reference to FIG. 1, head up display (HUD) system <b>10</b> can be utilized in various applications, including aviation, medical, naval, targeting, ground based, military, etc. HUD system <b>10</b> is preferably configured for use in smaller cockpit environments and yet provides an appropriate field of view and eye box for avionic applications.</p><p>HUD system <b>10</b> preferably includes an image source <b>20</b> and a substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b>. Substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b> is advantageously configured to provide an adequate field of view for HUD combiner applications. Image source <b>20</b> can be any device for providing an image including, but not limited to, a CRT display, an LED display, an active matrix liquid crystal display (LCD), etc. In a preferred embodiment, image source <b>20</b> is a micro LCD assembly and can provide linearly polarized light without serious loss of uniformity. In one embodiment, the vertical field of view for system <b>10</b> is from −15 to +9 degrees.</p><p>In addition, system <b>10</b> can include collimating optics <b>30</b> disposed between substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b> and image source <b>20</b>. Collimating optics <b>30</b> can be a single optical component, such as a lens, or include multiple optical components. In one embodiment, collimating optics <b>30</b> are configured as a catadioptric collimator. Collimating optics <b>30</b> can be any optical component or configuration of optical components that provide light (preferably collimated light) from image source <b>20</b> to an input <b>72</b> substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b>. Collimating optics <b>30</b> can be integrated with or spaced apart from image source <b>20</b> and/or substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b>.</p><p>In operation, system <b>10</b> provides images from image source <b>20</b> to a pilot or other operator so that the pilot can simultaneously view the images and a real world scene. The images can include graphic and/or text information (e.g., flight path vector, etc.) related to avionic information in one embodiment. In addition, the images can include synthetic or enhanced vision images. In one embodiment, collimated light representing the image from image source <b>20</b> is provided at an output <b>74</b> on substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b> so that the pilot can view the image conformally on the real world scene through substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b>. Waveguide combiner <b>40</b> is preferably transparent for viewing the real world scene through main surfaces or sides <b>84</b> and <b>88</b>.</p><p>In one preferred embodiment, system <b>10</b> is configured to provide uniform luminance and expand the pupil of system <b>10</b> in a single axis (e.g., along vertical axis <b>57</b>). In one embodiment, substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b> provides an approximately 100 mm vertical×75 mm horizontal exit pupil. Waveguide combiner <b>40</b> can effect the single axis pupil expansion and is configured to provide uniform luminance. The single axis expansion can be on the order of 2 to 7 times (e.g., approximately 4 times in one preferred embodiment). Other orders of pupil expansion are possible depending upon performance criteria, design parameters, and optical components utilized without departing from the scope of the invention.</p><p>Substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b> can have a variety of shapes including generally rectangular, oval, circular, tear drop-shaped, hexagonal, rectangular with rounded corners, square-shaped, etc.</p><p>In operation, substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b> advantageously receives light from image source <b>20</b> provided through collimating optics <b>30</b> at input <b>72</b> and provides light to a user at output <b>74</b>. Image source <b>20</b> provides information using a single color of light (e.g., a green light with wavelengths approximately between 500 and 550 nanometers (nm)). The light provided to substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b> is preferably linearly S polarized and collimated. Alternatively, other polarization, multiple colors, or other colors at different wavelengths can be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention.</p><p>Substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b> preferably performs two operations in a preferred embodiment. First, substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b> is disposed to provide a medium for transporting light by total internal reflection from input <b>72</b> to output <b>74</b>. Second, substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b> operates as a combiner allowing the user to view the light from image source <b>20</b> at output <b>74</b> and light from the real world scene through sides <b>84</b> and <b>88</b>. With reference to FIG. 2, substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b> can be configured to have input <b>72</b> and output <b>74</b> on side <b>84</b>.</p><p>Applicants have found that substrate guided HUDs can have difficulty achieving vertical fields of view greater than 18 degrees while maintaining uniform luminance. Surface relief diffraction gratings generally lose diffraction efficiency very quickly for viewing angles in excess of 18 degrees. At viewing angles above +9 degrees, waveguides using surface relief gratings can fail to propagate light due to failure of total internal reflection. At viewing angles below −9 degrees, the efficiency of the grating drops rapidly. Extending the field of view to viewing angles below −9 degrees can be achieved if grating efficiency is high. However, creating higher efficiencies causes the efficiency to be higher for all viewing angles, not just the lowest ones, thereby contributing to non-uniform luminance. Applicants have found that a grating that improves low angle reflections can be used without significant adverse changes to the rest of the field of view by employing an advantageous configuration of waveguide combiner <b>40</b>.</p><p>With reference to FIGS. 3A and 3B, waveguide combiner <b>40</b> can be comprised of a first waveguide <b>402</b> and a second waveguide <b>404</b>. Waveguide <b>402</b> includes a first input coupler <b>412</b> at input <b>72</b> and is preferably configured to provide light <b>415</b> in a first field of view (e.g., −15 to −3 degrees) for propagation via total internal reflection down waveguide <b>402</b> to a first output coupler <b>414</b>. Input coupler <b>412</b> also allows light <b>417</b> in a second field of view (e.g., −3 to +9 degrees) to pass through coupler <b>412</b> to second input coupler <b>422</b> of waveguide <b>404</b>. The efficiency to field of view response of coupler <b>412</b> is chosen to effect the appropriate diffraction of light <b>415</b> to output coupler <b>414</b> and transmission of light <b>417</b> to input coupler <b>422</b>. Applicants note that the field of view ranges discussed above are exemplary only; various design criteria and system parameters may effect the choice of fields of view for system <b>10</b> and substrate waveguide combiner <b>40</b>.</p><p>A second output coupler <b>424</b> is preferably disposed between coupler <b>414</b> and couplers <b>422</b> and <b>412</b> along a longitudinal or vertical axis <b>57</b> of waveguide combiner <b>40</b>. Coupler <b>412</b> is preferably provided on major side <b>426</b>, and coupler <b>414</b> is preferably provided on major side <b>84</b>. Coupler <b>424</b> is preferably provided on a major surface for <b>438</b>, and coupler <b>422</b> is preferably provided on a major side <b>88</b>. Sides <b>84</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>426</b>, and <b>438</b> are preferably approximately parallel. Couplers <b>414</b> and <b>424</b> are preferably offset from each other and can be overlapped at overlap region <b>439</b>.</p><p>Couplers <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> can be provided on separate substrates that are adhered to respective plates associated with waveguides <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>. Couplers <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> can also be provided directly on waveguides <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>. Waveguides <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> can be glass material. In one embodiment, waveguides <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> can have a thickness of between 0.25 and 1 inch and are an inorganic glass material having an index of refraction of approximately 1.55-1.8.</p><p>In preferred embodiment, input coupler <b>412</b> is disposed closest to collimating optics <b>30</b> and efficiently diffracts light <b>417</b> in the −15 to the −3 degree field of view into waveguide <b>402</b> and efficiently transmits light <b>419</b> in the −3 to +9 degree field of view through surface <b>438</b> of waveguide <b>402</b> to coupler <b>422</b>. In one preferred embodiment, coupler <b>412</b> is a volumetric grating, such as, a holographic grating. Coupler <b>412</b> is preferably designed to have a sharp angular cut-on in the transition region.</p><p>In one embodiment, coupler <b>412</b> has an efficiency to vertical field of view response <b>806</b> as shown in FIG. 6. Response <b>806</b> has cut-on region <b>804</b> at approximately −3 to −4 degrees. In FIG. 6, an X axis represents field of view and a Y axis represents diffraction efficiency for coupler <b>402</b>.</p><p>According to one embodiment, couplers <b>414</b>, <b>422</b>, and <b>424</b> can be volumetric (e.g., holographic) gratings. According to other embodiments, couplers <b>414</b>, <b>422</b>, and <b>424</b> can be surface relief gratings formed by lithographic mastering in a high index of refraction material. In another embodiment, couplers <b>414</b>, <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> can be formed by embossing, casting, etc. Although particular exemplary techniques and grating types are discussed above, other techniques, structures, and grating types can be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention.</p><p>In alternative embodiment, coupler <b>412</b> can be a Switchable Bragg Grating (SBG). In one embodiment, coupler <b>412</b> (embodied as the SBG) has an efficiency-to-viewing angle response <b>900</b> as shown in FIG. 7. Response <b>900</b> is when the SBG is turned on. In FIG. 7, an X axis represents field of view and an Y axis represents transmission efficiency in FIG. 7.</p><p>The SBG does not need to have a steep slope in the transition region and can be switched on and off at a high rate. In the on-state, the hologram associated with the SBG diffracts the light in the −15 to −3 field of view into waveguide <b>402</b>. In one embodiment, the SBG also can transmit light from the −3 to +9 degree field of view to the second waveguide. According to one embodiment, waveguide <b>402</b> is designed so that coupler <b>414</b> only diffracts the light in the −15 to −3 field of view to the eye of the pilot. The location of coupler <b>414</b> can be responsible for this effect. In the off-state, the SBG transmits all of the light into second waveguide <b>404</b>. However, waveguide <b>404</b> only directs the light in the −3 to +9 degree field of view to the eye of the pilot with a small overlap due to location of coupler <b>424</b>. Therefore, each of waveguides <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> displays a uniformly illuminated field of view.</p><p>Brightness may be reduced due to the duty cycle associated with the SBG. The SBG can have a duty cycle of 50% in one embodiment. Applicants believe that there is a potential for greater efficiency by using a more efficient input coupler <b>412</b> and having fewer bounces through each coupler <b>414</b> and <b>424</b>.</p><p>With reference to FIG. 8, additional recovery of efficiency can be realized by arranging LEDs in the back light of image source in two banks A first bank <b>910</b> generally illuminates the −15 to −30 degree area of the LCD image source <b>20</b>, and a second bank <b>912</b> generally illuminates the −3 to +9 degree area of the LCD image source. Each bank <b>910</b> and <b>912</b> is driven at a 50% duty cycle synchronized with SBG <b>916</b> disposed as coupler <b>412</b>. In such embodiment, synchronization circuit <b>920</b> can be utilized to provide signals to drive banks <b>910</b> and <b>912</b> of image source <b>20</b> in synchronism with SBG <b>916</b>. Synchronization circuit <b>920</b> can be a timing circuit or driver circuit for providing control signals to banks <b>910</b> and <b>912</b> and to SBG <b>916</b>. Circuit <b>920</b> can be part of source <b>20</b> in one embodiment.</p><p>With reference to FIG. 9, system <b>10</b> can include an electronic half wave retarder <b>492</b> disposed between collimating optics <b>30</b> and waveguide <b>402</b>. Alternatively, electronic half wave retarder <b>492</b> can be provided between image source <b>20</b> and collimating optics <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, retarder <b>492</b> is provided over image source <b>20</b> or at the output of collimating optics <b>30</b>.</p><p>In one embodiment, couplers <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> are polarization sensitive diffraction gratings. Coupler <b>412</b> can be bypassed by using P polarized light and rotating back to S polarized light using a static half wave retarder film <b>498</b> disposed on side <b>438</b> of waveguide <b>404</b> (e.g., the input side of waveguide <b>404</b>). Electronic half wave retarder <b>492</b> can be switched to S polarization so that light is diffracted by input coupler <b>402</b> into first waveguide <b>402</b>. In one embodiment using film <b>498</b> and electronic half wave retarder <b>492</b>, couplers <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> are embodied as surface relief diffraction gratings. Film <b>498</b> can be disposed on portion of side <b>438</b> in front of coupler <b>412</b>, on the entire surface of side <b>438</b>, or on surface of side <b>426</b> of waveguide <b>402</b>.</p><p>With reference to FIG. 10, a graph <b>1000</b> shows the efficiency versus field of view for system <b>10</b> utilizing waveguides <b>402</b> an <b>404</b> and a single plate waveguide. In FIG. 10, an X axis represents field of view, and Y axis represents efficiency. A response <b>1010</b> is for a combiner using waveguides <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>, and a response <b>1012</b> for a single plate waveguide. As shown in FIG. 11, response <b>1010</b> shows a more uniform efficiency over the field of view. In addition, the field of view associated with response <b>1010</b> is larger and ranges from −15 degrees to +9 degrees in one embodiment. Response <b>1012</b> shows a field of view from −9 degrees to +9 degrees.</p><p>With reference to FIGS. 4 and 5, couplers <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> can be provided directly on a glass plate (preferably having a high refractive index) associated with waveguide <b>404</b> in one embodiment. Similarly, coupler <b>414</b> can be provided directly on a glass plate (preferably having a high refractive index) associated with a waveguide <b>404</b> in one embodiment. In such embodiments, couplers <b>414</b>, <b>422</b>, and <b>424</b> can be surface relief gratings.</p><p>In certain embodiments, diffraction grating periods for coupler <b>412</b> can be matched to surface relief grating periods for couplers <b>414</b>, <b>422</b> and <b>424</b>. Thicknesses, index modulation and field of views can be optimized for system parameters. The placement of gratings or couplers <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>422</b>, and <b>424</b> on respective sides <b>426</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>88</b> and <b>438</b> of waveguides <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> are not shown in a limiting fashion.</p><p>It is understood that while the detailed drawings, specific examples, material types, thicknesses, dimensions, and particular values given provide a preferred exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the preferred exemplary embodiment is for the purpose of illustration only. The method and apparatus of the invention is not limited to the precise details and conditions disclosed. For example, although specific types of optical component, dimensions and angles are mentioned, other components, dimensions and angles can be utilized. Various changes may be made to the details disclosed without departing from the spirit of the invention which is defined by the following claims.</p><?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?>        </div>
